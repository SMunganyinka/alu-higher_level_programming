- Summary report for where each system falls out for example airtable is in this section and it does the following
- Have the system recommendation in a table format with pro's and con's 
  - Main features 
  - Price 
  - Pro's and Con's
  - Number of users

- The grant management application is for tracking applications and should help in outlining the methods for discovering and selecting projects or initiatives that
align with the Foundation’s mission.

- Wording needs to be more operational and support 
- Contracting for employees signing recruiment (Docusign )
- The systems security standards should be standard and ensures that even when they change it should be this is the standard for whatever standard they choose.

- Set Systems and administration as a table on about System and implmenetation timeline. (Then thy'll select and we choose)

  - In the table about systems have the pricing and cost analysis as a column.

  - Include descriptions to Hardware recommendations to make sure they fit into the standards and the overal framework

- Have a session where we discuss how each systems and technology solution will contribute to the overall goal of the operational framework we are building


[Service level agreement -they need to have SLA's for all the providers]



Attached are two docs -- One is the Inception report highlighting our work plan and what we will be providing
Secondaly is the doc I created highlighting like a framework outline not a framework outline though, it more of what needs thinking about and 
the help I need is in structuring a full on document based of the inception report that would be submitted as the deliverable of the work.

So your task in light of the above as well is to simply do this help develop a robust operational framework. 
We will adapt to existing WRI Policies, identify gaps and create policies/procedures for VIA Foundation's needs. We will asses and recommend essential systems (e.g. grants management systems) and support their implementation, ensuring alignment with ops framework


So basically, let's focus on the technological factor of the project. our focus for this documnent needs to be on Systems & Tools: the document framework should
indicate the key digital platforms or processes supporting the Foundation’s operations (e.g., finance software, communication tools). 

it should recommend specific tools based of the above data i shared, and give solutions to 
Data Management by Explaining how data is collected, stored, and protected to maintain confidentiality
and integrity.

It should also have high level IT Policies section this will summarizes the Foundation’s approach to preventing data breaches, managing user
access, and handling technological risks.

It should have a comprehensive Systems assessment and recommendation including:
- Requirement definition
- Identify the automation needs specific to VIA’s grant management processes—application intake,
evaluation, disbursement, monitoring, and reporting.
- Determine additional operational requirements.
- Solution evaluation, Evaluate multiple software platforms, focusing on scalability, compliance, cost, usability, integration
capabilities, and data security.
- Have a Recommendation report
- Provide a comparative analysis and recommend the most suitable system(s).
- Outline an approximate implementation timeline and considerations for integration.
- Liaison with vendor (Not Installation):
- Offer guidance to ensure the vendor’s configuration aligns with the new operational framework.

Note: The consultancy which is me does not include direct system installation or configuration, as those activities remain with the vendor.

So with every solution, framework and the tool you are going to recommend you need to highlight the why, why they are going to use that particular tool
how many people can use the tool, the learning gap, the cost breakdown, the inter-connection and platform dependency (meaning how does it intergrate with other tools) 
the security features and other just think about other question they'd ask in a meeting about the recommendation.
